<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Easy fast cake that can be made in the microwave in approximately 12 minutes.
        my favorite combinations are: chocolate cake mix with cherry pie filling or
        yellow cake mix with apple pie filling.
    </p>
    <p>Oh and this cake is made in the microwave.</p>

<h2>Ingrediets</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package of cake mix (12.25 ounce)</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling</li>
        <li>1/2 cup applesauce</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the box of cake mix, eggs, pie filling and applesauce till moist. Use a microwave safe bundt pan or substitute a microwave safe bowl that has a microwave safe cup or cone placed in the middle of it (to mimic a bundt pan). Pour mixture into the bowl around the cup.</li>
        <li>Bake on high for 6 minutes 30 seconds, turn and bake for another 6 minutes 30 seconds on high. Remove from oven and cover bowl with a dish and let stand for 5 minutes (this finishes the cooking process).</li>
        <li>Turn cake over onto dish and remove cone (cup) for a delicious quick dessert. Good hot with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping.</li>
